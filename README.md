# vim-utils

The `vim-utils` plug-in is a collection of Vim scripts I use daily. While
useful (at least to me), they don't do enough, per se, to justify their own
repo. The collection will be added to (slowly) as these scripts are being
transitioned from a previous repo while undergoing some refactoring and general
clean-up


## Installation

For ease of maintenance and updates, I recommend a plug-in manager such as
[Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) or
[Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git).

There is also the option of using the native Vim 8 packages loading (see: `:help packages`).
